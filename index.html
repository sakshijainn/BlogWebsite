					<h2>Can you relate to the Light of a Star?</h2>
					<br>
					<p id="text">
						A star , itself brings a smile on the face of millions of people. Who knows may be it also has its own journey… We, yes you and me admires its shine , the way it lightens and vanishes the dark side all of around! But as much I know journey? every letter of this word is build with a lot of patience and hardships. Do we ever wonder the shine we see is more of the part of its dedication to stay constant in its journey. Yes I am talking about a star. May be the immense glow we pleasantly see is the residual of you know ‘ a desire to reach at that point, however ’. So some days were out of the blue, some days it just rained , some days it just ends up with crying , giving all ups , opening up the wrist of dreams an let it just flow.<br><br>
						Pause…….<br><br>
						But alone you are , consoles yourself , gets up , wiping all your tears , brings up a smile and try to collect all that you have loosen control of scattered on the floor of world and then gripping it up with a grip of promise : a self promise to walk on the process . And then it becomes what it is today.<br>
						Who ? Of course star. What you thought. What I wonder more than being the smile of every eye , the journey has made it more than the smile of itself. Because now it prioritizes its smile above everything else. The biggest lesson it learned.<br><br>
						Who said it is easy ? Man its never easy it is frustating ,the process is exhausting but you also don’t have anything to complain about. Because this is what is you have created for yourself! No one knows better than you to get you a road-map of your self-dream.<br><br>
						Now the ball is in your court? “Either make it or break it”..</p>

               	    <h2>Friendship-Beautiful Word?</h2>
					<br>
					<p id="text">
						So, heard about friendship a lot! A very dreamy word, or an imaginary tie that everyone wants to have with someone in this life!The tie that understands you,loves you and cares for you endlessly!Do such thing exists? If yes,then “beautiful” is another word for ” friendship”.<br><br>

						So all this was the theoritical crap everyone wants to feel. Giving in a lot to the bond is all we learned about the friendship! Who says we don’t expect in friendship?whoever says actually lies to himself.<br><br>

						Obviously giving in so much would expect something in return. In return? What ?<br><br>
						The same love, affection, attention and honesty!<br><br>

						Now I can say if this overall tedious and technical process of tie exists- ” Friendship is beautiful”<br><br>

						Nothing is constant. No promise, no commitments! But irony is we always want our bond to be constant!<br><br>

						Believe me, saying anyone that I am there for you, no matter what sucks! Yet a very beautiful line to impress but most misinterpreted line so far.<br><br>

						So this beautiful word somewhere has circle of vicious words revolving around it. “Expectations”,”Insecurity” , ” Fear of loosing” and so on!<br><br>

						Our grip do have a handful of beautiful friendship but the vicious circle loosens up that grip and “beautiful” thing slips down like sand.<br><br>

						Yet now, I will say Friendship a beautiful word? !Think deep.<br><br></p>

					<h2>Yes,Introverts Exist!</h2>
					<br>
					<p id="text">
						Yes,Introverts Exist!
						Right now cool word implies gelling up with strangers, bold about opinions, leaving footprints
					    everywhere you go.<br>
						Wow? Such a cool friend, Onn to everything! Sparkling life, lots of friends, daily hangouts and
					    five star rating of instagram posts.<br><br>
						Reverse the whole scene:<br><br>
						Someone into deep self introspection, talking to himself, high solitude,a real smile on face, focused and determined!<br>
						Yeah,being alone and being with yourself are the two sides of a river!
						Ever heard?<br>
						Being with you is the best companion anyone can have!
						Very impressive line, huh?Read it somewhere for sure.<br>
						For introverts, this is their basis.Not impressing others about their life, giving five star ratings to their little things in life.Their opinions screams in silence! Believe me, its very loud and core to the truth.
						If you have such heartful persons in your life, you are then blessed with reality check.<br><br>
						Let introverts exist. They are needed!</p>

               	    <h2>MindFusion??</h2>
					<br>
					<p id="text">
						Mind- the most logical conduct, yet always into that “right thing”…Whenever your heart takes a step forward, mind comes as a stop sign with a list of do’s and dont’s with future predictability.<br><br>

						The flashlight of mind always got wrapped up by the sparkle of heart. Because heart wants to feel that “right thing” unaware of any chaos mind do.<br><br>

						Mindfusion-The honest conversation between heart and mind!<br><br>
						Where we always want our heart to win but we know somewhere deep inside the gut that mind deserves the actual win.
						<br><br>


						Why so ? Umm..Not to get hurt by the wounds of others brings us in the state of Mindfusion. Our past always tracks us. And when its hurtful, Mindfusion is at high stake.<br><br>

						
						So , why not try to walk together with heart and brain on the road of life, to complete the journey of happiness. Yet imaginative process, an integral part of everyone’s dream.<br><br></p>

					<h2>Situations Around!?</h2>
					<br>
					<p id="text">
						Is this ever happened ? We dream so vividly seems like living it in real. Analyzing all in and out situations, just waiting it to make it real with hands of burning passion! Eyes full of dreams and light of efficient hardwork to achieve that something in your life!<br>
						Then ? A sudden push to that something if happened! Numbs the mind for a second, feels like an alien in world of situations you have never dreamed of.<br><br>
						But mindfusion is your inbuilt function! <br>
						Subconscious screams very loudly This is the only option you are left with!<br><br>
						Can you guess who that someone is ? Situation(ironical sarcasm )</p>

               	    <h2>Circle of Minds!</h2>
					<br>
					<p id="text">
						What else could be more learning ?<br><br>

						Reading out the books, surfing through the internet or just sitting in a four cornered room? Actually nothing!: A trap we cannot discard from our life!
						Learning? Being around the people having some insane fuel of passion towards something!This already sounds so cool. Sitting with some mindful minds. Transmitting and Receiving of ideas via network of that “out of the box determination” is the transparent learning process !<br><br>

						Moving into the depths of things, knowing all the colours between black and white is what we get if we are lucky enough to find that circle of minds.<br><br>
						But not everyone understands this today!
						<br><br>
						People with triggering minds to talk share and express is what not everyone feels ! How about sharing your level of knowledge with someone who is just out of the box! This all sounds so cool.
						<br><br>
						But such thing do not exists today. Leads us to meet that Circle of minds hypothetically only!<br><br></p>

					<h2>PIECES OF HOPE.</h2>
					<br>
					<p id="text">
						The one and only ray of light we are always in search of. ‘Hope’,its essence is itself enough to console the inner self. Whenever the heart goes weak and mind is not in state it connects the both to gather the broken us for once!
						<br>
						Very surprisingly,we are always in rush of colouring every picture of life with the pencil of hope. Resembles like a mirror to grip ourselves up to face what we are hiding away from.<br><br>
						Nothing is more beautiful if we find that spark of hope is in continuous process of making us
						smile even more. <br>
						Every day comes with a lot of expectations.But what i think let your hope empower your expectations,to guard you very protectively from all the things that brings down you in your eyes!<br><br>
						Never ever let any of your hope die. It is the only way to solve the puzzle of
						life’s every little moments.<br><br>
						<b>Hope more, Smile more!</b></p>
